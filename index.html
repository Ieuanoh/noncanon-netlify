        Non Canon exists apart from the story we know and love. A concurrent storyline, a different perspective, the world we experience through someone else's eyes; familiar but insightful for its new dimension. <br />
        <br /> In another life entirely, Non Canon gathers maelstroms of guitar noise and feeds them with caustic, yelled, (a)stringent sentences, calling himself Oxygen Thief. Having spent ten years deftly swerving expectation at every measure as OT,
        Non Canon turns things on their head again. He threads cello where there may have been feedback once, places a third chord where two key changes could have lain, and repeats a chorus line where a scream may have broken the silence instead. He's
        returned to his acoustic beginning, that’s true, but he’s torn that up and refused to retain his previous self-taught lessons.
        <br />
        <br /> When recording the self-titled album, all the strings, piano and drums were written on a computer before being sent to musicians to learn and play on recordings. Chris T-T's piano playing stand out on 'Bad Twin', while Ben Marwood and
        Charlie Barnes (a touring member of Bastille) contributed backing vocals, along with Gareth from My First Tooth playing drums, and the guitarist from Barry’s first ever band playing violin and viola. Non Canon is a new story, but it’s a story
        of its own, one that we will soon know and love with its own history, character and setting.
