  Naming things <em>is</em> hard. It's also, very important. The people who read your code later 
  (most likely, you) - will thank you. I don't write code with the goal of never having 
  to change it. I write it with the intention of being able to change it quickly and easily 
  in the future. Being able to quickly read/understand the code, will allow for this to be a 
  reality. The first step in this, is naming things well.

  When I'm naming variables - I normally write them down (with an actual pen --gasp-- ), on 
  post-it notes and stick them to my monitor. Every hour or so I'll glance at them and 
  see what jumps out at me. Often times my most critical/constructive thoughts are within the first 4 
  seconds. When I don't do this, I invent a series of variable names that are tied for first 
  place in horribleness.

  variable_19, portW, curr, navCURR, currLeft, pos2, and one of my real gems... 
  to_do_changeLater.Those are actual variable names from slop that I have written. I named these variables in 
  haste. And now I have no idea what data they store. How could I expect anyone else 
  to have any semblence of a fucking clue what my shitty variables are storing behind their thick veiled walls. 
  Variable names like this are basically keeping secrets from the reader. Great variable names don't keep 
  secrets. They stand at the tops of mountains and broadcast to the world in big neon lights what they're up to.

  Important points from other people:
  Variables are our first step in the notion of abstraction
